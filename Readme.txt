== Description ==

WP Linkpush Buddy allows blog posters to use Linkpush services directly from their WP Add New Post form.

When you install the plugin, you need to set your Linkpushing username and API key. To get an API key you need to have a linkpushing account. You can have a free account which will allow you to submit your posts to the Linkpushing Indexer where we guarantee your post will be crawled by the Search engines. If you have a paid subscription account, you can post your new entries directly to your Linkpushing account for further promotion.

On setting your username and API key, the plugin will retrieve your account type from the Linkpushing server. Once you have entered your details, you will see an option on the New Post form allowing you to specify if you want to submit that post to Linkpushing for Indexing or Promotion (depending on your account type). On submitting your post, if you select to submit to Linkpushing,net, the URL and tags you have used in the post will be passed to Linkpushing for indexing or further promotion.
